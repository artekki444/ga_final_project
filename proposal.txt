Final Project Proposal 

Dataset: Instacart Orders 


1. Hypothesis/Assumptions 

Hypothesis: As a user orders more often, the variety of product category increases. 

As users get more familiarized ordering from Instacart, I want to test if they are exploring their options in other categories. 
I am assuming there are main or usual categories that repeat vs other items they might buy here and there. 
I want to explore the data and see if the size of users' shopping carts are becoming more variety and bigger as they purchase more. 

2. Goals and Success Metrics

I would like to track: 
	a) users purchase data and see which categories are most vs least popular. 
	b) size of shopping cart based on order frequency 
	c) numbers of product categories in shopping cart 
	d) correlation between numbers of product categories and order frequency 


Risk or Limiations 
	a) Popularity of orders in product category can be highly skewed. 
	b) Business is highly concentrated on very selective products.
